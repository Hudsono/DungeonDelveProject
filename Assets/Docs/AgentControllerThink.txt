Agents and Controllers
 - By separating who or what (the Agent) is Controlling something, we can generalise and re-use code for input and controls.
 - One particular Controller has a set of input outlets.
 - One particular Agent hasa set of input plugs.
 - We plug in the Agent to the Controller.
 - The Controller doesn't care if all or none of its outlets are plugged-in to an Agent's inputs.

Agent
 - Sends input to a particular Mover script, like CharacterMover.

PlayerAgent: Agent
 - Reads input from the player themselves

AIAgent: Agent
 - Reads input from a NavMeshAgent + some other script abilities.




Agent has a list of strings mapped to Unity's input system.

How the strings are sent to the Controller depends on its type:

PlayerAgent simply sends them via getInput

AIAgent sends them based on what its NavMeshAgent thinks + some other factors.
 - E.g., based on the agent object's movement, play movement animations.
 - E.g., if it gets close to the player, send Attack.
